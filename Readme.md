# This is my playgound

I'm doing the Udemy Course [iOS 13 Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp) and this is all the apps developed in the course. Some of then aren't exactly apps, some are just random code for testing stuff. All ordered in the way I leaned and improved.

## Here the list of apps

With some screenshots too :P

### 01 - Iam Rick

Yeah the most basic stuff, no functionality on this one.

<image style='height:400px' src='./.github/assets/readme/04_image.png'>

### 05 - AutoLayout

This is just a learning how to improve and how to use constrains from the xCode app while layouting screens.

### 06 - Calculator

This is a challenge for the layouting, good challenge by the way.

### 07 - Xylophone

How to use some audio apis on the swift and iOS.

<image style='height:400px' src='./.github/assets/readme/07_image.png'>

### 08 - Iam Rick

The egg calculator, good project, cool stuff. I'd to use a some search on the Apple docs to know what to do.

<image style='height:400px' src='./.github/assets/readme/08_image.png'>

### 10 - Iam Rick

This is the base app for a choose your own adventure, cool stuff. After this course I'll tackle again on this project and increase a little to have published app on the Apple Store.

<image style='height:400px' src='./.github/assets/readme/10_image.png'>

### 11 - Iam Rick

Yeah, I'm fat...

This app I learned how to use multiple screens and segues on iOS. Cool stuff

<image style='float:left; height:50px' src='./.github/assets/readme/11_icon.png'>
<image style='height:400px' src='./.github/assets/readme/11_image.png'>    
<image style='height:400px' src='./.github/assets/readme/11_image2.png'>

### 12 - Iam Rick

Some studies on classes and stuff like that. Maybe I'll play a little extra with this subject to create some basic classes that I can drag'n drop on other projects

### 13 - Iam Rick

The challenge for multiple screens, good stuff.

<image style='float:left; height:50px' src='./.github/assets/readme/13_icon.png'>
<image style='height:400px' src='./.github/assets/readme/13_image.png'>    
<image style='height:400px' src='./.github/assets/readme/13_image2.png'>

### 14 - Iam Rick

This is a more robust project with network API call and some use of GPS location.

<image style='height:400px' src='./.github/assets/readme/14_image.png'>

### 15 - Protocols and Delegates

This is some studies on the protocols and delegates. Good pattern by the way, and a little reminder to myself in the future, this is not the same as observer, there is only one delegate per object created.

### 16 - Iam Rick

This is the challenge for the network stuff. I'm so used to `fetch` api from the browser that this way of doing looks very weird, I'll probably try to create a wrapper to make easier in the future for me.
